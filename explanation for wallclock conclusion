What we can conclude is that as the grid gets more fine the wallclock time per step increases at a nearly linear rate. This is conveyed through the scaling exponent α = 1.09. This near-linear scaling tells us that the icoFoam solver is greatly efficient and the computational effort required for each finer grid remains relatively the same even as the global matrix size grows. We can also notice that as the simulations get bigger the difference between the wallclock and execution times becomes more and more neglible compared to the total time.
